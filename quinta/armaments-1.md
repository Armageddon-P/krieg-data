**R/P-22** is a light submachine gun (sort of), used as an auxillary weapon of choice by soldiers of the assault companies. It's becoming more and more common, but engineering mistakes lead to frequent jams that are not that easy to get through. It's fed by 6.6x40mm rimmed ball cartridges on a 30-cartridge feed strip, which makes transporting of this SMG pretty hard when it's loaded. Muzzle velocity is about 650 meters per second, rate of fire can reach about 350 rounds per minute, thus discharging a belt within six to seven seconds.
